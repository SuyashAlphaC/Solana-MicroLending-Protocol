# Solana Micro-Lending Protocol üè¶

An on-chain, peer-to-peer micro-lending protocol built on the Solana blockchain. This project provides a framework for financial inclusion by enabling users to create lending pools, build on-chain credit history, and access capital in a transparent and secure environment.

## üß† Core Concepts

The protocol is designed around a few key entities that work together to create a decentralized lending ecosystem:

**The Platform**: The central hub governed by a platform authority. It sets the rules, such as transaction fees and loan limits.

**Lending Pools**: Lenders can deposit assets into token-specific pools to provide liquidity. In return for locking their assets, they earn interest from loan repayments.

**Borrowers & User Profiles**: Any user can be a borrower. Each participant has a UserProfile account that serves as their on-chain financial identity, tracking their loan history, repayment rates, and a dynamic credit score.

**On-Chain Credit Score**: A user's reputation is quantified through a credit score calculated from their on-chain activities. This includes successful loan repayments, defaults, social attestations, and verified transaction history.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

This protocol is developed using the Anchor framework for secure and rapid development on Solana. The architecture is centered around several key state accounts that manage the protocol's data and logic:

- **Platform**: A singleton account that stores global configuration like fees, loan amount limits, and platform-level statistics.

- **UserProfile**: Stores all data related to a user's reputation, including their credit score, loan history, and verification status (KYC, email, phone).

- **LendingPool**: Manages the liquidity, base interest rates, and loan terms for a specific token asset.

- **Loan**: An account created for each loan, tracking its amount, status (Requested, Approved, Disbursed, Repaid, etc.), due date, and repayment progress.

- **LenderDeposit**: Tracks an individual lender's deposit amount and their corresponding shares within a specific lending pool.

- **SocialAttestation & TransactionHistory**: Accounts that store off-chain data brought on-chain by a trusted authority to help build a user's credit profile.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust & Cargo
- Node.js & Yarn (or npm)
- Solana Tool Suite
- Anchor Framework

### Installation & Testing

#### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-name>
```

#### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### Build the Program

This command compiles the Rust code and generates the program's IDL (Interface Definition Language).

```bash

## üîí Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This project is for demonstration and educational purposes and has not been audited by a third party. While security best practices have been followed using the Anchor framework, please exercise caution.

### Key security measures implemented:

- **Account Validation**: All instructions use Anchor's constraint system (`has_one`, `seeds`, `bump`) to ensure that only legitimate accounts can be passed in.

- **PDA Ownership**: All state accounts are Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) owned by the program, preventing external modification.

- **Arithmetic Checks**: Using `checked_add` and `checked_sub` to prevent overflows and underflows.

- **Role-Based Access**: Critical functions are restricted to designated signers (e.g., `platform.authority`, `lending_pool.authority`).

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

We have a long-term vision for this protocol. Contributions are welcome in the following areas:

- **Advanced Collateralization**: Support for NFTs or other digital assets as loan collateral.

- **Decentralized Governance**: A DAO-based model for managing platform parameters and treasury funds.

- **Off-Chain Data Integration**: Deeper integration with oracle services for more robust credit scoring.

- **Frontend UI**: Building a React-based dApp for interacting with the protocol.
